Hiii! This is my personal site. Check here for pictures, updates, or to talk :)

The "chat" feature is going to be found by going to the top menu and selecting "Blog Posts", and under the first blog post, or any after that, there will be a comment section where can post comments to chat back and forth! Like youtube comments except waaay less unhinged haha. Ill make more blog posts as "updates" if you wanna check there for what im up to whenever we can talk throughout the day! man this developer stuff is hard work, i need a coke. and a cheeseburger. okie love you bye!!

This also will serve as the template for my company site coming soon! But i might make some changes to the layout

Always thinking of you <3 hope you're doing well, love you

# ===== 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
