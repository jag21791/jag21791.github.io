Hiii :) 

I know it won't be much, but we can chat in the comments below to get more talking time in 🥺 
Avni I know things don't look good right now and we have a rough road ahead, but I promise you we are so worth it and this rough time will go by so fast you won't even be like "brugguh this is taking so long" more like "wow! that was fast!" hehe 
This relationship is more important to me than you know, and i know its just as important to you too. i would do anything to help keep it from getting bogged down because of whats going on at home.

Some positive things to remember if you need a pick me up:
1. I love you <3
2. If you need any reassurance or are having a rough day dealing with the extra distance, reach out to me for ANYTHING. There isn't a thing I won't do to make you happy, because you are everything to me, and thats just objectively true!
3. I can send you so many pictures of flowers, just ask! Ill send as many as i can during work hours too :)
4. we can call on your lunch breaks! just lmk ahead of time and ill make myself free
5. After this next week (starting Aug. 4), Ill be able to come visit you in GB MD WOOT WOOT and we can get thai food and watch airplanes fly over and maybe even snuggle ❤️
6. Even if we can't work out together THIS week, we can still MAYBE do couples long distance workouts while im in huntsville and also call if you get a little more freedom. I know it just depends on your parents so, if not, refer to number 5!^^
7. You make me happy every day and I don't want to be with anyone else for the rest of my life! You are enough for me always and forever <3 

I promise, everything will be okay both at home and with us. The only thing ill ever ask of you beyond loving me is that you trust me when I say that okay?

Lastly,

We are best friends, companions in life, and soulmates. Nothing is going to change that or keep us apart.

I love you infinitely <3 mwah x 1000000000000000e+1000000000000000

Hiii! This is my personal site. Check here for pictures, updates, or to talk :) the best part is only you and i have the link so its like our little digital hideaway hehe. Definitely a work in progress but pretty neat!

The "chat" feature is going to be found by going to the top menu and selecting "Blog Posts", at the very bottom there is a comment section where can post comments to chat back and forth! Like youtube comments except waaay less toxic haha. Ill make more blog posts as "updates" if you wanna check there for what im up to if we can't talk throughout the day! 

I also think one of the features is you can see it right from the bottom of the homepage as well! So i guess theres two locations to leave comments but its still a work in progress!

geez louise this developer stuff is hard work, i need a coke. and a cheeseburger. okie love you bye!!

This also will serve as the template for my company site coming soon! But i might make some changes to the layout

Always thinking of you <3 hope you're doing well, love you
